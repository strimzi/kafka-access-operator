# Strimzi Access Operator

Strimzi Access Operator provides a Kubernetes operator to help applications bind to an [Apache KafkaÂ®](https://kafka.apache.org) cluster that is managed by the [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) cluster operator.

The operator creates a single Kubernetes `Secret` resource containing all the connection details for the Kafka cluster.
The removes the need for applications to query multiple Kubernetes resources to get connection information.
The `Secret` follows the conventions laid out in the [Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes v1.0.0](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/).

The operator is built using the [Java Operator SDK](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk).

## Running the Access Operator

For the operator to start successfully you need the Strimzi `Kafka` and `KafkaUser` custom resource definitions installed in your Kubernetes cluster.
You can get these from the Strimzi [GitHub repository](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/tree/main/install/cluster-operator),
or use the [Strimzi quickstart guide](https://strimzi.io/quickstarts/) to also deploy the Strimzi cluster operator and a Kafka instance at the same time.

### Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-strimzi-access-operator`:

```bash
$ helm install my-strimzi-access-operator oci://quay.io/strimzi-helm/strimzi-access-operator
```

The command deploys the Strimzi Access Operator on the Kubernetes cluster with the default configuration.

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-strimzi-access-operator` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-strimzi-access-operator
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the Strimzi Access Operator utility and deletes the release.

### Configuration

The following table lists some available configurable parameters of the Strimzi chart and their default values.
For a full list of supported options, check the [`values.yaml` file](./values.yaml).

| Parameter                            | Description                                               | Default  |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `image.tag`                          | Override default Drain Cleaner image tag                  | `latest` |
| `image.imagePullPolicy`              | Image pull policy for all pods deployed by Drain Cleaner  | `nil`    |
| `resources.limits.cpu`               | Configures the CPU limit for the Access Operator Pod      | `256Mi`  |
| `resources.limits.memory`            | Configures the memory limit for the Access Operator Pod   | `500m`   |
| `resources.requests.cpu`             | Configures the CPU request for the Access Operator Pod    | `256Mi`  |
| `resources.requests.memory`          | Configures the memory request for the Access Operator Pod | `100m`   |
| `livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds`  | Liveness probe initial delay (in seconds)                 | `10`     |
| `livenessProbe.periodSeconds`        | Liveness probe period (in seconds)                        | `30`     |
| `readinessProbe.initialDelaySeconds` | Readiness probe initial delay (in seconds)                | `10`     |
| `readinessProbe.periodSeconds`       | Readiness probe period (in seconds)                       | `30`     |

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
$ helm install my-strimzi-access-operator --set replicaCount=2 oci://quay.io/strimzi-helm/strimzi-access-operator
```

## Using the Access Operator

To make use of the Access Operator, create a `KafkaAccess` custom resource (CR).
You must specify the name of the `Kafka` CR you want to connect to.
You can optionally also specify the name of the listener in the `Kafka` CR and a `KafkaUser`.
See the [examples folder](https://github.com/strimzi/kafka-access-operator/tree/main/examples) for some valid `KafkaAccess` specifications.

If you do not specify which listener you want to connect to, the operator uses the following rules to choose a listener:
1. If there is only one listener configured in the `Kafka` CR, that listener is chosen.
2. If there are multiple listeners listed in the `Kafka` CR, the operator filters the list by comparing the `tls` and `authentication` properties in the `Kafka` and `KafkaUser` CRs to select a listener with the appropriate security.
3. If there are multiple listeners with appropriate security, the operator chooses the one that is of type `internal`.
4. If there are multiple internal listeners with appropriate security, the operator sorts the listeners alphabetically by name, and chooses the first one.

Once the Access Operator has created the binding `Secret`, it updates the `KafkaAccess` custom resource to put the name of the secret in the status, for example:

```yaml
...
status:
  binding:
    name: kafka-binding
```

The `Secret` created by the Access Operator has the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: kafka-binding
type: servicebinding.io/kafka
data:
    type: kafka
    provider: strimzi

    bootstrap.servers: # comma separated list of host:port for Kafka
    bootstrap-servers: # comma separated list of host:port for Kafka
    bootstrapServers: # comma separated list of host:port for Kafka

    security.protocol: # one of PLAINTEXT, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL or SSL
    securityProtocol: # one of PLAINTEXT, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL or SSL

    # Provided if TLS enabled:
    ssl.truststore.crt: #  Strimzi cluster CA certificate

    # Provided if selected user is SCRAM auth:
    username: # SCRAM username
    password: # SCRAM password
    sasl.jaas.config: # sasl jaas config string for use by Java applications
    sasl.mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    saslMechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512

    # Provided if selected user is mTLS:
    ssl.keystore.crt: # certificate for the consuming client signed by the clients' CA
    ssl.keystore.key: # private key for the consuming client
```

Developers can make this `Secret` available to their applications themselves, or use an operator that implements the [Service Binding specification](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/) to do it.
