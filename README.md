# Access Operator for Strimzi

This project provides a Kubernetes operator to help applications bind to an [Apache KafkaÂ®](https://kafka.apache.org) cluster that is managed by the [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) cluster operator.

The operator creates a single Kubernetes `Secret` resource containing all the connection details for the Kafka cluster.
The removes the need for applications to query multiple Kubernetes resources to get connection information.
The `Secret` follows the conventions laid out in the [Service Binding Specification for Kubernetes v1.0.0](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/).

The operator is built using the [Java Operator SDK](https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk).

## Running the Access Operator

The latest release of the Access Operator can be started using the manifests in the `install` directory.
The [dev guide](https://github.com/strimzi/kafka-access-operator/blob/main/development-docs/DEV_GUIDE.md) describes how to build and run the Access Operator from source.

For the operator to start successfully you need the Strimzi `Kafka` and `KafkaUser` custom resource definitions installed in your Kubernetes cluster.
You can get these from the Strimzi [GitHub repository](https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/tree/main/install/cluster-operator),
or use the [Strimzi quickstart guide](https://strimzi.io/quickstarts/) to also deploy the Strimzi cluster operator and a Kafka instance at the same time.

### Deploying the Access Operator

To deploy the Access Operator in the `strimzi-access-operator` namespace:

```bash
kubectl apply -f install
```

The command deploys the Strimzi Access Operator on the Kubernetes cluster.

### Removing the Access Operator

To delete the `strimzi-access-operator` deployment:

```bash
kubectl delete -f install
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the Strimzi Access Operator utility and deletes the deployment.

## Using the Access Operator

To make use of the Access Operator, create a `KafkaAccess` custom resource (CR).
You must specify the name of the `Kafka` CR you want to connect to.
You can optionally also specify the name of the listener in the `Kafka` CR and a `KafkaUser`.
See the [examples folder](https://github.com/strimzi/kafka-access-operator/tree/main/examples) for some valid `KafkaAccess` specifications.

If you do not specify which listener you want to connect to, the operator uses the following rules to choose a listener:
1. If there is only one listener configured in the `Kafka` CR, that listener is chosen.
2. If there are multiple listeners listed in the `Kafka` CR, the operator filters the list by comparing the `tls` and `authentication` properties in the `Kafka` and `KafkaUser` CRs to select a listener with the appropriate security.
3. If there are multiple listeners with appropriate security, the operator chooses the one that is of type `internal`.
4. If there are multiple internal listeners with appropriate security, the operator sorts the listeners alphabetically by name, and chooses the first one.

Once the Access Operator has created the binding `Secret`, it updates the `KafkaAccess` custom resource to put the name of the secret in the status, for example:

```yaml
...
status:
  binding:
    name: kafka-binding
```

The `Secret` created by the Access Operator has the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
    name: kafka-binding
type: servicebinding.io/kafka
data:
    type: kafka
    provider: strimzi

    bootstrap.servers: # comma separated list of host:port for Kafka
    bootstrap-servers: # comma separated list of host:port for Kafka
    bootstrapServers: # comma separated list of host:port for Kafka

    security.protocol: # one of PLAINTEXT, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL or SSL
    securityProtocol: # one of PLAINTEXT, SASL_PLAINTEXT, SASL_SSL or SSL

    # Provided if TLS enabled:
    ssl.truststore.crt: #  Strimzi cluster CA certificate

    # Provided if selected user is SCRAM auth:
    username: # SCRAM username
    password: # SCRAM password
    sasl.jaas.config: # sasl jaas config string for use by Java applications
    sasl.mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    saslMechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512

    # Provided if selected user is mTLS:
    ssl.keystore.crt: # certificate for the consuming client signed by the clients' CA
    ssl.keystore.key: # private key for the consuming client
```

Developers can make this `Secret` available to their applications themselves, or use an operator that implements the [Service Binding specification](https://servicebinding.io/spec/core/1.0.0/) to do it.

## Container signatures

Strimzi Access Operator containers are signed using the [`cosign` tool](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).
Strimzi currently does not use the keyless signing and the transparency log.
To verify the authenticity of the container, you can copy the following Strimzi public key into a file:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAET3OleLR7h0JqatY2KkECXhA9ZAkC
TRnbE23Wb5AzJPnpevvQ1QUEQQ5h/I4GobB7/jkGfqYkt6Ct5WOU2cc6HQ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Use the following `cosign` command to verify the signature:

```
cosign verify --key strimzi.pub quay.io/strimzi/kafka-access-operator:latest --insecure-ignore-tlog=true
```

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Strimzi Access Operator publishes the software bill of materials (SBOM) of our containers.
The SBOMs are published as archives with `SPDX-JSON` and `Syft-Table` formats, and they are signed using cosign.
For releases, they are also pushed into the container registry.
To verify the authenticity of the SBOM signatures, use the Strimzi public key:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAET3OleLR7h0JqatY2KkECXhA9ZAkC
TRnbE23Wb5AzJPnpevvQ1QUEQQ5h/I4GobB7/jkGfqYkt6Ct5WOU2cc6HQ==
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

Use the following `cosign` command to verify the signatures:

```
cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --bundle <SBOM-file>.bundle --insecure-ignore-tlog=true <SBOM-file>
```
